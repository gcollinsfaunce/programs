This is the start of a card game (Blackjack).
Working on creating it as an AI based game and will be making it into a VR also and furthering it into something more.
I'm looking to make the cards into a something animated and fun interaction setup so the cards actually ask the player if they wish to hit or stand.
Hope that anyone has advice or is willing to collab on this project as well. Thank you :)
